\arguments{
\item{ex}{dataframe A dataframe containing the expression data.}

\item{axis_lab}{named character vector. Names are names of channels and values are corresponding names of markers. If provided, then the x-axis label is channged from the channel name (in \code{chnl}) to the common name. If \code{NULL}, then the axis label is kept as the channel name. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{col}{named character vector. Names are names of cutpoints in \code{cp}, and values are corresponding colours. If provided, then the colours of the vertical lines indicating the cutpoints are set to these colours. If \code{NULL}, then the colours are set automatically using \code{RColorBrewer}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{bin}{integer. Number of bins of histogram. Default is 300.}

\item{min}{numeric. Minimum value to plot for histogram. If \code{NULL}, then all values are plotted. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{chnl}{character. Name of column in \code{ex} to plot.}

\item{cp_lab}{named character vector. Names are names of cutpoints, and values are common names of cutpoints to be used in the cutpoint type legend. If provided, then the cutpoint type legend's values are set to these. If \code{NULL}, then the untransformed cutpoint names are used. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object.

\description{
Plots a histogram of a specific channel. Allows removal of the cells with the lowest value, and display of cutpoints.
