\title{Identify cells that express at least one cytokine}
\usage{
.get_pos_ind(
  ex,
  gate_tbl,
  chnl,
  chnl_alt = NULL,
  gate_type_cyt_pos,
  gate_type_single_pos
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ex}{dataframe. Expression data.}

\item{gate_tbl}{dataframe. Contains gates for specific sample for specific gate method only (but for
all markers of interest).}

\item{chnl}{character vector. Specifies channel(s) for which the cell must be positive.}

\item{chnl_alt}{character vector. Specifies channel(s) for which the cytokine-positive cutpoint for the channels
in \code{chnl} may be used, if the cells are positive for these cytokines. If \code{NULL},
then all channels in unique(gate_tbl$chnl) besides those in \code{chnl} are used. If \code{""},
then no channels are used for \code{chnl_alt} (but cytokine-positive thresholds
may be used if \code{gate_type_cyt_pos = TRUE} and length(\code{chnl}>2). Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A logical vector, with TRUE for every cell that is negative for every other cytokine and for the cytokine in question with
any other cytokine. FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Returns a logical vector specifying whether each cell produces at least one
of the cytokines specified, with the ability to use base, cytokine-positive and single-positive
thresholds.
}
\details{
For example, if \code{chnl} is \code{'Ho165Di'} and \code{chnl_alt} is \code{c('Nd146Di', 'Gd156Di')}, then
only cells that are positive for Ho165Di are returned, where positivity for Ho165Di is calculated using
the \code{gate_type_single_pos} threshold if a cell is negative for both Nd146Di and Gd156di using base thresholds,
but using \code{gate_type_cyt_pos} threshold if the cell is positive for either Nd146Di or Gd156Di.
