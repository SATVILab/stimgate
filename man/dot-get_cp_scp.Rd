\title{Get cutpoint (helper function to main function)}
\usage{
.get_cp_scp(ll, cps)
}
\arguments{
\item{ll}{numeric vector. Numeric vector of log-likelihoods, where
the i-th element is the log-likelihood where the cutpoint is the
i-th element in \code{cps}.}

\item{cps}{numeric vector. Points that were treated as the cutpoints when evaluating
the log-likelihood in \code{ll}.}
}
\value{
A single number specifying the cutpoint. Note that if
}
\description{
Get the cutpoint for a given channel, based on being "high" for other channels. The
cutpoint is chosen as the cutpoint such that a piecewise function using it as the "break"
point in a logistic regression model has the highest possible log-likelihood.
}
\details{
If two possible cutpoints have the same log-likelihood, then the
larger cutpoint is returned.
