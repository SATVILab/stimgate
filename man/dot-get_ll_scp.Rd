\title{Get log-likelihood at specified cutpoints}
\usage{
.get_ll_scp(high_ind_tbl, cps)
}
\arguments{
\item{high_ind_tbl}{tibble. Tibble containing a column \code{cut} with expression values for the marker
to be cut and a numeric columm \code{high} that has value \code{1} when the cell was high for at least one of the specified markers and 0 otherwise.}

\item{cps}{numeric vector. Points to treat as cutpoints when evaluating the log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of log-likelihoods for each cutpoint in \code{cps}.
}
\description{
Calculates the log-likelihood of models where the cutpoint is the "break" point in a
piece-wise logistic regression model.
}
\details{
This function fits a model that is flat until the cutpoint and
can then jump and take on a linear term at the cutpoint.
