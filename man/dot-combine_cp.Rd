\title{COmbine gates across indices}
\usage{
.combine_cp(cp, gate_combn)
}
\arguments{
\item{cp}{named numeric vector. Values are gates and names are indices within
original GatingSet to which gate applies.}

\item{gate_combn}{'no', 'min', 'mean', 'trim20',  'median' or 'max'. Specifies
method of combining the gates in cp. 'no' and 'prejoin' do not apply common gates,
whereas each of the others do.}
}
\value{
named list. Each list corresponds to the gates for the set of indices
for a given gating method and gate grouping method. The name indicates
the gating method and the gate-grouping method, which are separated by an underscore.
The element is a named vector, where values are the gates for the individual samples and
the names are indices of the samples with the original GatingSet to which gates apply.
