\title{Plot proportin of positive cells for a given marker expression level}
\usage{
.plot_prop(
  high_ind_tbl,
  cp,
  cut,
  axis_lab = NULL,
  col = NULL,
  cp_lab = NULL,
  rug = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{axis_lab}{named character vector. Names are names of channels and values are corresponding names of markers. If provided, then the x-axis label is channged from the channel name (in \code{chnl}) to the common name. If \code{NULL}, then the axis label is kept as the channel name. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{col}{named character vector. Names are names of cutpoints in \code{cp}, and values are corresponding colours. If provided, then the colours of the vertical lines indicating the cutpoints are set to these colours. If \code{NULL}, then the colours are set automatically using \code{RColorBrewer}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{cp_lab}{named character vector. Names are names of cutpoints, and values are common names of cutpoints to be used in the cutpoint type legend. If provided, then the cutpoint type legend's values are set to these. If \code{NULL}, then the untransformed cutpoint names are used. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{rug}{numeric between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If provided, then a rug plot with this proportion of the cells is plotted. Note that this is from the high end, so for example if \code{rug = 0.1}, then a rug for the cells from the 90th quantile upwards is plotted. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Plots the proportion of cells for the marker for which a cutpoint is sought that are high for the specified markers.
