\arguments{
\item{data}{GatingSet. GatingSet from which to draw the data.}

\item{path_project}{character. Path to project directory. Results are saved
here.}

\item{pop_gate}{character vector. Populations for which separate gates are
to be calculated.}

\item{pop_sub}{character vector. Sub-populations of \code{pop_gate} to plot,
in addition to pop_gate. These populations are appended to pop_gate, after
the addition of a forward slash (so do not begin with a forward slash).}

\item{batch_size}{numeric. Number of samples per batch. Batches are
calculated assuming that numbers 1 to \code{batch_size} are batch one,
(\code{batch_siz} + 1) to 2 * \code{batch_size} are batch two, and so on.}

\item{ind_in_batch_uns}{integer. Index within a given batch corresponding to
unstim. For example, if \code{ind_in_batch_uns} is four, then the fourth
sample within each batch is regarded as unstim.}

\item{in_in_batch_gate}{integer vector. Indices within a given batch for
which gates need to be calculated.gating parameters}
