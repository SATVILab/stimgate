\title{Get cutpoints for a range of FDRs across sample(s)}
\usage{
.get_cp_uns_fdr(cut_stim, ecdf_uns, fdr, cp_min, ind_gate, ind_uns, min_cell)
}
\arguments{
\item{cut_stim}{list. Each element must be a numeric vector
that corresponds to the readings for the marker for a sample for which a cutpoint
is to be  calculated. Each such numeric vector must be ordered
in descending order.}

\item{ecdf_uns}{function. Empirical CDF for the unstim stimulation sample
for this blood sample.}
}
\value{
A named list, where each element is a named vector
referring to the cutpoints for all the samples for which
gates are required for this batch for a given FDR.
