\arguments{
\item{data_name}{character. Name of GatingSet in workspace.}

\item{ind_data}{numeric vector. Indices in GatingSet for which data should be drawn.}

\item{ind_uns}{numeric. Index in GatingSet of sample containing unstim measurements for this batch.}
}
\value{
A list, where each element is a tibble containing the cell expression measurements from
a single sample for the channels named in \code{cut} and \code{high}, as well as the following columns:
\itemize{
\item ind: index of sample in original GatingSet.
}
}
\description{
Takes a GatingSet and returns the expression data for the columns selected in \code{cut} and \code{high} as a tibble for selected samples in the GatingHierarchy.
