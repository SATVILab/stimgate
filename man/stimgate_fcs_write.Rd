\description{
Uses the gates to write FCS files of marker-positive FCS files.
}
\details{
This function processes flow cytometry data to identify and export cytokine-positive
cells to FCS files. It requires that gates have been pre-computed using
\code{\link{stimgate_gate}} or that a complete gate table is provided.

The function will create the output directory and write FCS files for samples
that contain cytokine-positive cells. If no positive cells are found in a sample,
no FCS file will be written for that sample.

# Complete workflow example
library(stimgate)

# Load your GatingSet (gs) and define batch structure
# batch_list <- list(batch1 = c(1, 2, 3), batch2 = c(4, 5, 6))

# First, run gating to create gates
path_project <- tempfile("stimgate_project")

#   .data = gs,
#   path_project = path_project,
#   pop_gate = "root",
#   batch_list = batch_list,
#   marker = c("IL2", "IFNg")  # your cytokine markers
# )

# Then write FCS files of cytokine-positive cells
path_output <- tempfile("fcs_output")
# stimgate_fcs_write(

#   .data = gs,
