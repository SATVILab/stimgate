\title{Get counts and frequencies for across populations and samples, with cutpoints set separately for groups of samples}
\usage{
.get_cp_stats_tbl_pop_samples(.data, ind, pop, wins, chnl_cut, high, cp_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{GatingSet. Each element corresponds to a single sample to which the cutpoint(s) in
a specified \code{cp_obj} output must be applied.}

\item{ind}{list. A list, where each element is a numeric vector specifying the indices of the
GatingHierarchy objects in \code{.data} to get the counts and frequency for the
cutpoints specified by \code{cp} for.}

\item{pop}{character vector. Each element fully specifies the parent population of cells which must be
divided into positive/negative cells based on their individual values for the variable specified by \code{cut}
and the cutpoint(s) specified by \code{cp_obj}.}

\item{cp_obj}{list. A list, where each element is a list returned by \code{get_cp}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns fcs, pop, type, cp, count and freq, with corresponding
values being the fcs file gated on, parent population, cutpoint type,
cutpoint value, count of positive cells and frequency of positive cells.
}
\description{
Gets cell counts and frequencies for samples using pre-specified cutpoints.
The cutpoints are to be calculated before this function is applied using
\code{get_cp}, and are extracted
from the list returned by \code{get_cp}. This means that, for example, that a
single cutpoint can be calculated using a group of samples, and then we
can apply that cutpoint on the constituent samples to find counts and frequencies
on a per-sample (rather than grouped) basis.
}
\details{
Note that the f-score assumes that the smaller count of cells is a strict subset of
the larger count of cells. This holds when the difference between manual and automatic
gating is due to differences in the placement of a single univariate cutpoint,
but does not hold in general.

Note that this differs from .get_cp_stats_tbl_pop_samples_elem in that
it may apply different cutpoints to different sets of samples within \code{.data}. \code{.get_cp_stats_tbl_pop_samples_elem}
applies the single set of cutpoints it receives to all specified samples.
