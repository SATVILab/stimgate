\usage{
.plot_gate_batch(gate_tbl, ind_batch, params, gate_lab, col, pop_res)
}
\arguments{
\item{cp_obj}{object of class cp_obj.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cp_plot}. This object is a list,
which consists of a set of plots for each sample that went into creating
Within each such element are the following plots: plot_hist (histogram of channel),
plot_ll_scp (log-likelihood for first changepoint),
plot_prop (binned probability of positivity across expression range),
plot_ll_dcp (log-likelihood for second changepoint),
plot_2d (list of hex plots of cut channel against high channels),
plot_dcp_hist (histogram of marker expression above first changepoint) and
plot_count_stats_by_cp (list of plots of names 'p_prop', 'p_count', 'p_freq'
and 'p_std_prop' that show various stats for a range of cutpoints).
