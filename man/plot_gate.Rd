\title{Plot gating-related plots for a list of cp objects}
\usage{
plot_gate(gate_tbl, params, pop_sub, gate_lab, col)
}
\arguments{
\item{cp_obj}{object of class \code{cp}. Output from get_cp.}

\item{exc_min}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then all cells with values for at least one
of the plotted channels equal to the minimum across any cell in those channels are excluded
from the plots.}

\item{node}{character vector. If provided, then plots are made using the cutpoints provided by \code{cp_obj_list} for each of the populations specified in node, in addition to the population initially gated on. If \code{NULL}, then  only the population initially gated on has plots made for it.}

\item{cp}{character vector. Names of cutpoints to plot.}

\item{ind_uns_in_batch}{integer. Integer specifying which index of a given batch is unstim. For example, if ind_uns is 3, then the third element in cp$params$ind is taken to be the unstim distribution. If cp$params$ind were 26:30, then 28 would be the index of the unstim distribution for that batch in cp$data.}

\item{auto_y_lim}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the limits of the y-axis for the count and frequency plots are set equal to double the count and frequency, respectively, of the lowest specified cutpoint.}

\item{save}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the plots are saved as PNGs. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{save_r_obj}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the plots are saved as an R-readable object. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{return}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the list of plots generated are returned. If \code{FALSE}, then the function returns \code{TRUE} invisibly. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cp_obj_list}{list. List where each element is an object of class \code{cp}.}
}
\value{
A list, where each element is of class \code{cp_plot}.
}
\description{
Creates the plots needed to inspect the cutpoints selected for a
given cp object. If the cp_obj was gated as a batch, then
the plots are created for each sample that went into the batch as well.
