\usage{
axis_limits(p, limits_expand = NULL, limits_equal = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{object of class 'ggplot'. Limits are adjusted for this plot.}

\item{limits_expand}{list. If not \code{NULL},
then it is (effectively) passed onto \code{ggplot2::expand_limits} to
ensure that certain values are included in the plot (such as, for example, 0
if that is the minimum value possible but it may not be plotted). If not named, then # nolint
must consist of one numeric vector that will then force all values in the numeric value # nolint
to be included in the plot. If named, then must have names \code{x} and/or \code{y}, # nolint
with the elements again being numeric vectors that must be included in plot.}

\item{limits_equal}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the ranges on the x- and y-axes # nolint
must be equal. Effectively applied after expand_grid is applied. Default is \code{FALSE}. # nolint}
}
\value{
A modified ggplot object with adjusted axis limits according to the specified parameters.
}
\description{
Manage axis limits.
Fix axis limits to be equal between x- and y-axes,
and/or expand axis coordinates.
The primary use of \code{axis_limits}
is forcing the x- and y-axes
to have the same limits "automatically"
(i.e. by inspecting the \code{ggplot} object,
thus not requiring the user to manually
calculate limits to pass to \code{ggplot2::expand_limits}).

\examples{
data("cars", package = "datasets")
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point()

axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_equal = TRUE
)

# both axes
axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_expand = list(200)
)
# x only
axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_expand = list(x = 75)
)
# y only
axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_expand = list(y = 200)
)
# lower and upper expansion
axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_expand = list(
    y = c(-50, 200),
    x = c(-10, 75)
  )
)

# note that when fixing range and expanding, range is fixed
# after expansions are applied, so effectively the larger expansions apply to both.
# compare the following output to the previous output:
axis_limits(
  p,
  limits_expand = list(
    y = c(-50, 200),
    x = c(-10, 75)
  ),
  limits_equal = TRUE
)
