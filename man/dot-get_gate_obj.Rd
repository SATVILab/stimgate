\arguments{
\item{pop_gate}{character
Population for which separate gates are to be
calculated.}

\item{cut}{character.
Name of channel to get gate for.}

\item{high}{named numeric vector.
Names are channel names and values are
thresholds above which a value for a given cell in this channel is deemed
'high'.}

\item{gate_combn}{named list. Named list where names
are one of 'pre_join', 'mean', 'median', 'trim20' or
'min', and elements are character vectors of 'scp',
'dcp', 'tg', 'midp', 'uns#' and 'uns#r' (where # are
FDRs expressed as percentages). Each element therefore
specifies the method of combining gates from individual
samples within a group for a subset of the automated
gating methods. \code{'grp'} means to gate jointly,
whereas all of the others do what they sound like. If
not specified (i.e. \code{NULL}), then all gates are
performed individually on each sample. Default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{tol}{numeric. Tolerance value for the
\code{cytoUtils:::.cytokine_cutpoint} method.
Default is 0.5e-8 for CyTOF and flow.}

\item{fdr}{numeric vector. False discovery rates at
which the unstim-based gate is to be calculated.
Default is \code{c(0.3, 0.2, 0.1)}.}
