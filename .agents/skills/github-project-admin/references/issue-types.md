# Issue Type and Class design

Use Class or Issue Type to describe **what kind of work item this is**. Keep that classification separate from routing, priority, status, due dates, milestones and native parent/sub-issue hierarchy.

The default vocabulary is deliberately rich enough to distinguish common kinds of work without adding a second functional-lane taxonomy.

| Class / Issue Type | Preferred colour | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task | YELLOW | The ordinary fallback: a specific piece of work when no more informative type adds useful meaning. |
| Bug | RED | An unexpected fault, regression or incorrect behaviour. |
| Enhancement | GREEN | A bounded improvement to existing work, material, method, process or software. |
| Data | PINK | Acquisition, intake, stewardship, transformation or validation of source or derived data, including production of analysis-ready data. |
| Analysis | PURPLE | Work whose main output is a quantitative or analytical result, inference, evaluation or reproducible computation. |
| Deliverable | ORANGE | One bounded formal output or event that is handed over, submitted, presented, released, assessed or otherwise consumed as an output. |
| Documentation | GRAY | Durable guidance, records or reference material rather than a substantive project output. |
| Epic | BLUE | A broad coordination outcome that remains useful as a planning object while several independently meaningful pieces of work are tracked separately. |

`Task` is intentionally the fallback category. The more specific types are specialisations of ordinary work, not philosophically disjoint categories. Use a specific type only when it makes the issue easier to understand, filter or manage.

`Data` combines source-data and processed-data work because both have a dataset or data state as their main output. Use `Analysis` instead when the main output is a result, inference, evaluation or reproducible computation based on data.

`Deliverable` supersedes the narrower `Report` name. It includes reports, manuscripts, presentations, posters, submissions, assessments, grant applications, registered protocols, handovers, release packages and software releases. Supporting work remains its own type: for example, fixing a figure can be a Task or Enhancement while the final submitted manuscript is a Deliverable.

`Research` is not part of the default vocabulary. Exploratory or decision-oriented work can normally be a Task; work whose main outcome is an analytical result can be Analysis; work that develops or improves an existing method or system can be Enhancement. A repository may deliberately retain another local type when it carries a useful stable distinction.

## Hierarchy is independent of type

Parenthood and Class are independent. A Task, Deliverable, Analysis, Enhancement or other non-Epic type may have sub-issues and remain that type.

Use Epic only when the broad coordinating outcome is useful in its own right, usually because it spans several independently actionable pieces or phases. Do **not** make an issue an Epic merely because it is top-level, has children, or would otherwise leave the Project without a root issue.

A presentation can remain a Deliverable while having preparation children. A simulation analysis can remain Analysis while having data-generation, fitting and figure children. A Project may have several top-level issues and no single root Epic.

## No standard Workstream dimension

The active project-administration model does not use Workstream as a standard semantic dimension. Do not require every issue to carry a second functional-lane classification such as `Methods`, `Analysis`, `Validation`, `Reporting` or `Administration`.

Use the existing dimensions instead:

- repository/Project topology and declared `project:*` labels route an issue to the correct overall Project;
- optional `subproject:*` labels provide genuine local grouping where needed;
- Class or Issue Type describes the kind of work item;
- native parent/sub-issue relationships provide scope and decomposition;
- Priority, Status and Due date carry planning state;
- issue titles and bodies carry the specific subject matter.

A live custom field named `Workstream` in an older Project is legacy/unmanaged state unless the repository deliberately documents it as non-standard metadata. The shared skill must not infer semantic meaning from that field name, require it, or populate it merely because it exists.

## Milestones are optional checkpoints

GitHub Milestones may be useful when several issues converge on one real temporal checkpoint, release or submission. They are optional and are not a replacement for Workstream.

A single formal output often needs only a Deliverable issue and a due date. Use a Milestone when the shared checkpoint itself helps organise several issues, such as a release, D3 submission or end-of-term assessment.

## Colours are presentational

Preferred colours make repeated types easier to recognise across Projects, but colour is not semantic state. GitHub's standard single-select palette is `BLUE`, `GRAY`, `GREEN`, `ORANGE`, `PINK`, `PURPLE`, `RED` and `YELLOW`; reuse colours when necessary. Preserve useful existing colours unless the requested outcome includes changing them.

## Migration and refinement

When standardising an existing Project, inspect the actual issues first and prefer useful distinctions over cosmetic churn.

- Map `Report` to `Deliverable` when the existing value represents formal outputs.
- Map `Raw data` and `Processed data` to `Data` unless the repository deliberately retains that distinction as useful local vocabulary.
- If an older Project uses `Research`, classify each affected issue as Task, Analysis or Enhancement according to the work rather than applying a blind one-to-one rename.
- Keep useful repository-specific Issue Types when they genuinely improve planning.
- Migrate or remove a legacy Workstream field only when that migration is explicitly authorised. Read current values before removal and verify the resulting Project and issue state afterwards.
- Do not rewrite closed history merely to make old records look identical unless the requested migration includes it.
